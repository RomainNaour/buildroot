	  Enable the basic set of recommended features.

	  Without that, the EFL developpers consider the build to be
	  potentially broken and won't provide any support for it.

	  This turns on the following features:

	  - bullet: If you have chosen to disable physics support, this
	    disables lots of core functionality and is effectively never
	    tested. You are going to find features that suddenly don't work
	    and as a result cause a series of breakages. This is simply not
	    tested so you are on your own in terms of ensuring everything
	    works if you do this

	  - fontconfig: If fontconfig is disabled, this is going to make
	    general font searching not work, and only some very direct
	    'load /path/file.ttf' will work alongside some old-school ttf
	    file path searching. This is very likely not what you want, so
	    highly reconsider turning fontconfig off. Having it off will
	    lead to visual problems like missing text in many UI areas
	    etc...

	  - gstreamer 1.x: If Gstreamer 1.x support is disabled, it will
	    heavily limit your media support options and render some
	    functionality as useless, leading to visible application bugs.

	  - libfribidi: Fribidi is used for handling right-to-left text
	    (like Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Persian etc.) and is very likely
	    not a feature you want to disable unless you know for absolute
	    certain you will never encounter and have to display such
	    scripts. Also note that we don't test with fribidi disabled so
	    you may also trigger code paths with bugs that are never
	    normally used.

	  - libsndfile: If you disabled audio support in Ecore, this is not
	    tested and may create bugs for you due to it creating untested
	    code paths. Reconsider disabling audio.

	  - pulseaudio: The only audio output method supported by Ecore
	    right now is via Pulseaudio. You have disabled that and likely
	    have broken a whole bunch of things in the process. Reconsider
	    your configure options.
	    NOTE: multisense support is automatically enabled with
	    pulseaudio.

	  - util-linux' libmount: Libmount is used heavily inside Eeze for
	    support of removable devices etc... and disabling this will
	    hurt support for Enlightenment and its filemanager.
